# Song Generation Using NEAT
This project uses the NEAT algorithm to generate MIDI tracks for different instruments. The instruments are defined in the INSTRUMENTDICT and the number of output nodes for each instrument is defined in INSTRUMENTOUTPUT. The Song class takes in the following parameters:

-songlength: The length of the song in number of bars (default is 5)
-generations: The number of generations for the NEAT algorithm to run (default is 5)
-pattern: A list of integers representing the instruments in the order they should appear in the final output (default is [9, 2, 10])

### The Song class has several methods:

-saveRatings(): This method saves the best fitness score for each generation for each instrument.
-getTrack(): This method takes in a channel, tracknumber, and input and returns a MIDI track for the specified instrument using the NEAT algorithm.
-createTracks(): This method takes in a winner genome, inputs, and instrument and returns a MIDI track for the specified instrument using the winner genome.
-finalOutput(): This method creates the final MIDI output by combining the tracks generated by the createTracks() method.
-main(): This method calls the getTrack() method for each instrument in the pattern, then calls the finalOutput() method to create the final MIDI output.


## Installation
Before running the code, make sure to have the following packages installed:
-pygame
-neat-python

To install the required packages for this project, use the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code
To run the code, use the command:

```bash
python song.py
```

Running this code will generate a song of length 20, consisting of Drums, Bas and Organ
